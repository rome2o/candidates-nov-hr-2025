# Abhinav Bansal

Applying for Position: Junior Software Engineer
Are you available for fulltime work (40h per week)?: Yes
Comments: I’m a full-stack developer who enjoys building things that actually solve problems not just look good on a resume. I work mainly with the MERN stack and modern cloud tools, and I like taking projects from rough ideas to something stable, structured, and deployable. I’m detail-oriented, I don’t shy away from debugging messy issues, and I pick up new tech quickly. Outside of work, I’m constantly experimenting with side projects and refining my skills because I like staying ahead, not playing catch-up.
