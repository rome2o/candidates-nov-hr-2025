Comments: Apart from what’s on my resume, I’d say I’m someone who’s always curious to learn and improve. I enjoy solving real-world problems using technology, and I take pride in writing clean, efficient code. During my academic projects, I focused on both teamwork and attention to detail — for example, I developed an e-commerce Android app using Java and Firebase, and also worked on a machine learning model for emergency response optimization.  Outside academics, I enjoy outdoor sports like soccer and cricket, which have helped me build teamwork and discipline. Overall, I’m eager to learn from professionals in this field and contribute positively to the team.
