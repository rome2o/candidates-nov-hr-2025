PROJECTS
Live Data Sentiment Classiﬁer (Reddit)

Developed a Python-based pipeline to scrape real-time Reddit comments,
perform sentiment analysis using VADER , and train an ML classiﬁer
(Logistic Regression with TF-IDF). Automated data storage in SQLite and
implemented model persistence with Joblib .

Hostel Finder Assistant Voice Bot

Developed  an  intelligent  voice  bot  using  OpenAI  and  Vapi  AI  to  assist
users in ﬁnding hostels based on their location and preferences. Designed
and  integrated  a  voice-based  interaction  system  to  provide  a  seamless
and  user-friendly  experience.  The  bot  ensures  fast,  accurate  information
retrieval,  allowing  users  to  get  real-time  responses  and  personalized
recommendations for hostel options. This project highlights the eﬀective
use  of  AI  and  natural  language  processing  to  enhance  user  convenience
and decision-making.

Data Analysis and Machine Learning with Python

For  a  Programming  for  Big  Data  (PBD)  project,  utilized  Python  libraries
such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data preprocessing,
analysis,  and  visualization.  Cleaned  and  transformed  datasets  to  extract
meaningful insights, created visual representations, and applied machine
learning algorithms like K-Means for clustering and Linear Regression for
predictive  modeling.  Focused  on
improving  data  quality  and
understanding patterns within the data.

Real-Time Twitter Data Streaming and Storage Using Apache
Hadoop

For the ﬁnal Programming for Big Data (PBD) project, implemented real-
time  data  streaming  using  Apache  Hadoop,  Apache  Flume,  and  the
Twitter  API.  Conﬁgured  the ﬂume.conf ﬁle  with  API  keys  obtained  from
the  Twitter  Developer  platform  to  collect  live  tweets  based  on  speciﬁc
keywords.  The  streaming  data  was  ingested  and  stored  in  Hadoop
Distributed  File  System  (HDFS)  for  further  processing  and  analysis.  This
project  demonstrated  the  integration  of  big  data  tools  to  manage  and
store large-scale, real-time data streams eﬀectively.

E-Commerce Android Application(FYP)

Designed  and  developed  a  feature-rich  e-commerce  Android  application
for the ﬁnal year project using Java and Google Firebase as the backend.
The application catered to both local and branded buyers, allowing users
to browse and purchase products seamlessly. A standout feature enabled
users to request items not available in the catalog directly from suppliers,
ensuring a personalized shopping experience. The application focused on
user-friendly  navigation,  real-time  data  synchronization,  and  eﬃcient
product management through Firebase integration.

Machine Learning (06/2025)
Completed  a  short  course  where  I  revised  concepts  such  as
feature
data  preprocessing,  model
evaluation,  and
engineering.  The  course  focused  on  supervised
learning
techniques,  with  hands-on  practice  in  algorithms  like  linear
regression.  Toward  the  end,  we  explored  deep  learning,
including  artiﬁcial  neural  networks  (ANN)  and  convolutional
neural networks (CNN), along with their practical applications.
