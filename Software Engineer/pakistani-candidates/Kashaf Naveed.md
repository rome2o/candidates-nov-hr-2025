WORK EXPERIENCE

Mern Stack Developer (Independent Projects): December, 2023 – Personal Learning
I learnt MERN Stack development from Saylani Mass IT (SMIT), where as Full Stack Developer, I built multiple full-stack projects using MongoDB,
Express, React, and Node.js.This experience strengthened my skills in building responsive web applications, RESTful APIs, and integrating front-end
with backend seamlessly.

Mern AI Developer (Internship) — Three Arrows: October, 2025 – Present
During my MERN AI internship, I gained hands-on experience with new technologies, advanced logic building, and real-time project development. I
contributed to a Multi-Level Marketing system and developed a multilingual model integrated with the MERN stack, designed to efficiently handle
dynamic language switching. This internship greatly enhanced my technical expertise and deepened my understanding of building web solutions.

AI Researcher & AI Instructor— NexaVision : July, 2025 – September, 2025
As an AI Researcher,I did the research work on the company’s coming project which is based on AI Agents in the field of medicines, also
researched on the society which issue our society is facing due to the lack of the technology.Further project details remain confidential. As an AI
Instructor,Teach students AI/ML from scratch to advanced level and introduce the students,Modern AI technologies.We end this course by
completing projects on the Document classifier,Diabetes Predictor ,Gender Voice recognition.

MERN Stack Projects:
• Payment Gateway – Secure MERN-based system with Stripe API and real-time validation.
• WhatsApp Clone – Real-time chat app using Socket.IO and Firebase Auth.
• AI Chatbot – Chatbot using Gemini API integrated into React UI.
• MultiLevel Marketing – Deal with payments gateways,Binary Tree structure,Commission Distribution and much more.

PROJECTS

Try-On Spectacles : MERN + AI (ONNX, MediaPipe, OpenCV, FastAPI) Try live





Built a real-time AI-Powered Virtual Spectacles Try-On app working on laptop, phone, and tablet cameras.
Used MediaPipe + ONNX for face landmarks and OpenCV for overlay alignment.
Integrated with FastAPI backend and MERN for smooth AR experience. Deployed project frontend on Vercel and backend on Railway.

Multilingual Model : MERN + AI (LLM , Deep Learning)





It automatically extracts the text from the DOM in the form of nodes and pass to the Model and then model show this on the page.
Used MM2M100 model for translation and it is a multilingual encoder-decoder (seq-to-seq) model and can translate up to 100 languages.
Achieved approximately 87% accuracy.
