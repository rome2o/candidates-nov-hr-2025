Work Experience

Software Developer

Fusion Systems and Sevices

Feb 2024 - March 2025

Developed a Chrome extension from scratch using javascript specifically for Salesforce
that  generates  relative  XPath  expressions  when  a  user  clicks  on  an  HTML  element.  It
also allows users to select any area on a Salesforce page, automatically creating a page
object for the selected section. This tool streamlines the process of automation testing by
providing  accurate,  reusable  XPaths  that  can  be  directly  utilized  in  test  scripts.  The
extension  was  built  with  a  focus  on  cross-platform  compatibility,  ensuring  that  the
generated  XPaths  work  consistently  across  different  Salesforce  orgs.  Integrated  AJAX
commands  to  communicate  with  APIs  for  real-time  data  handling  and  updates.  Utilized
Bootstrap  for  creating  a  responsive  and  user-friendly  frontend  interface,  enhancing
overall usability and accessibility for testers and developers alike.
