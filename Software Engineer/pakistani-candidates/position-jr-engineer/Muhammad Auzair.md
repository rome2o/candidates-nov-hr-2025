Developed the backend  in  Django for a  Student  Application Management System (Cust App)  that
automates  the  generation  of  official  academic  letters  and  certificates  (e.g.,  English  Proficiency,
Enrolment Verification) previously handled manually.

Enabled students to submit application requests from anywhere, reducing in-person office visits by
90% and cutting administrative processing time by 70%.

Built  secure  admin  interface  allowing  staff  to  create  new  application  types  using  predefined
template tags (placeholders) in letter content that are auto filled from the database with student
data (e.g. name, program, department)

Implemented  workflow  automation,  on  request  submission  the  system  generates  fully  formatted
official  letters  upon  approval  of  the  relevant  employee.  The  employee  can  approve,  review,  and
reject the requests.

Scaled  to  handle  1000+  student  requests  with  role-based  access  control,  secure  authentication,
and optimized API performance using Django Rest Framework.

Investment Tracker (Django, React)

•  My team and I developed a crypto investment tracking website that allows users to monitor their

portfolio in real-time.
I built the backend using Django, handling user authentication, adding new crypto tokens, and
managing investments, payouts, and liquidations.
The system  automatically  calculates  profit  and  loss,  giving users  clear insights  into  their
investments.
Users can track whether their crypto holdings are in profit or loss, with detailed liquidation and
payout management.
The platform ensures secure and efficient investment tracking, providing a seamless experience for
crypto investors.
Deployed the project on AWS EC2 for testing.

anomaly alerts.
