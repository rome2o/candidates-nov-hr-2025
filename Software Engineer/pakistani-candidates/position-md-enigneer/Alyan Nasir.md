Blog writer AI agent
An AI agent built using crewAI, a Python framework used to build AI agents using LLMs. I used a free LLM API (gpt-3.5-

• Three agents (Researcher, Writer, Humanizer) each perform their tasks with some limitations.
• The researcher searches for relevant content based on a topic entered by the user.
• The  writer  then  writes  the  content into a  proper  article  based  on the research.
• Humanizer  proofreads  and  humanizes  the  content  to  make  it  look  like  human-written  content.
