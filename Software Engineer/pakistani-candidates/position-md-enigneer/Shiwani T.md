PROJECTS

Support Ticket Agent Using LangGraph and RAG

• Built a ticket classification and response agent using LangGraph and RAG.
• Integrated multi-step classification and human escalation for rejected outputs.
• Used Ollama Mistral for response generation and LangGraph Studio for testing.

GitHub Crawler Pipeline

• Developed a scalable data crawler using GitHub’s GraphQL API and PostgreSQL to gather star counts

for 100,000 repositories. Designed a flexible schema for continuous updates, implemented rate-limit

handling, and automated the pipeline with GitHub Actions and containerized Postgres services.

X- Reportify (Medical Imaging)

• Developed a system using YOLO for anomaly detection and BioGPT for report generation.

• Fine-tuned models on a domain-specific dataset to improve accuracy and context understanding.

Sales Agent Using Google ADK

• Designed a conversational sales assistant using LLMs and Google ADK for product-related queries.

• Tested response accuracy and implemented feedback mechanisms for improvement.

Spotify Clone

• Built a front-end clone of Spotify as an academic project using ReactJS, HTML, and Tailwind CSS.

• The project strengthened my understanding of UI design principles and front-end structure
