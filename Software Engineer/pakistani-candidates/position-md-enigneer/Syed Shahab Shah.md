About

As a seasoned Software Engineer with over 4 years of experience, I specialize in building scalable,
high-performance web systems with a strong focus on modular architecture, system reliability, and
clean developer experience. My technical expertise spans modern frameworks including JavaScript,
TypeScript, React, Next.js, Node.js, NestJS, and Python-based frameworks such as FastAPI and Flask.

I bring full-stack proﬁciency with a strong emphasis on backend architecture designing microservice
oriented systems, implementing robust APIs, and optimizing database and messaging workﬂows using
MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Redis, and event-driven patterns. My frontend work emphasizes accessibility
(WCAG), responsive UX, and interactive interfaces powered by React Query, Zustand, Redux,
GraphQL, and Framer Motion.

I’ve led the integration of GenAI capabilities embedding LLMs into production-grade systems for tasks
such as dynamic pricing suggestions, recommendation system and semantic search. These
implementations leverage tools like LangChain, OpenAI API, and vector-based retrieval pipelines.
Additionally, I’ve built and maintained CI/CD pipelines, containerized deployments, and cloud-based
infrastructure to support continuous delivery and system scalability.
