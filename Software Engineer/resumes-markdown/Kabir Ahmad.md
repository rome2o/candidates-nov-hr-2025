Company: TwoCX – Role: Full Stack Developer

From: 2023 - To: Present

At TwoCX, I serve as a Full Stack Developer, where I develop modern and responsive web applications

using React and Next.js for the frontend and Node.js with Express for the backend. My responsibilities

include collaborating with designers and product teams to translate concepts into functional and

scalable digital experiences. I also contribute to the creative side of the business by designing websites,

business cards, flyers, and social media content, helping brands establish a strong and consistent visual

identity. In addition to development, I manage project tasks, support team members technically, and

communicate directly with clients to gather requirements, provide updates, and ensure alignment. This

role allows me to combine both technical and design skills to deliver end-to-end solutions. I’ve worked

on improving performance, accessibility, and design consistency across multiple projects, ensuring a

seamless experience for users and better outcomes for clients.

Hijaz Hospital

Full Stack Development and Design – Payload CMS, Next.js, Tailwind CSS,
JazzCash Integration, SEO

Hijaz Hospital is a healthcare organization accepting donations to support its services. I designed and

developed the entire website from scratch using Figma and implemented it using Next.js for the

frontend and Payload CMS for content management. The site is fully responsive, optimized for

performance, and tailored to deliver a clean, accessible user experience for donors and visitors.

A key feature of this project was integrating the JazzCash payment gateway, enabling donations via

mobile number or credit/debit card. I implemented payment processing using Next.js API routes,

handling both the JazzCash callback and IPN (Instant Payment Notification) securely and reliably. This

allows the hospital to receive donations in real-time and maintain transaction records effectively.

Tailwind CSS was used to ensure a modern and consistent UI design throughout the site. This project

showcases my ability to lead a project from design to deployment, including third-party integrations

and backend API work.
