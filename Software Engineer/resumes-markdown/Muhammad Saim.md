Profile

Iʼm a Software Engineer with experience in building modern web applications using React, Next.js, NestJS and AWS. I focus on
creating clean, scalable, and high-performing solutions from frontend to backend. Iʼve worked with tools and libraries like
Tailwind, Ant Design, Material UI, Redux, Recoil, TanStack, and GraphQL to build interactive and efficient user interfaces.
On the backend, I use NestJS and MySQL to develop secure and scalable APIs with JWT authentication, WebSocket
communication, and optimized database performance. I also have experience managing deployments and infrastructure using
AWS, Docker, Terraform, and CI/CD pipelines through GitHub Actions and CodePipeline.
I enjoy solving problems, improving performance, and collaborating with teams to deliver reliable, user-friendly applications.
Always eager to learn new technologies and improve my skills to build better software.

Professional Experience

10/2024 – Present  |  Islamabad, Pakistan

Construction Project Builder – an enterprise construction management platform that unifies plan viewing, field workflows,
and form automation across web and offline-capable experiences.

•Led the front-end architecture for an Nx-based React 18 monorepo, orchestrating Auth0, Apollo GraphQL, Sentry, and
RxDB providers with lazy module loading to deliver a resilient, offline-capable field operations platform.
•Built a drag-and-drop form builder library (Dnd Kit + MUI + Zustand) that enforces layout rules, supports i18n, and is
published as a reusable Nx package powering dynamic workflows across the suite.
•Implemented an offline mutation queue atop Apollo Link and RxDB with optimistic updates, conflict resolution, and
background sync, ensuring uninterrupted jobsite data capture in low-connectivity environments.
•Engineered an advanced plan management UI with geospatial overlays, bulk task operations, undo stacks, and role-based
access controls, backed by Apollo cache hygiene and service-worker broadcast updates.
•Hardened the front-end toolchain with Nx task orchestration, GraphQL codegen, Husky hooks, and Playwright smoke
suites, enabling repeatable CI/CD and fast developer feedback loops.

Company Official Website:
