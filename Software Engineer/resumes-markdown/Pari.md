PROJECTS

Intelligent Discord Bot using Langchain and OpenAI
Built a Discord bot with Python, Langchain, and OpenAI for context-aware interactions. Implemented
message handling, chat history, and response triggers. Deployed for real-time, human-like
conversations using Discord API.

RAG System with Llama 3.1
Built a RAG system using Llama 3.1, Langchain, FAISS, and OLlama for efficient information retrieval
and response generation, optimizing embedding storage with sentence Transformers.

Full-Stack Expense Tracker
Engineered a secure expense tracker with React frontend and Django REST Framework, leveraging JWT
authentication for multi-user access. Utilized SQLite for structured data storage, enabling users to log
and categorize expenses in real-time.

E-commerce Product Classification  (Python)
Built a multi-class classification model with TensorFlow to categorize e-commerce products into
Electronics, Household, Books, and Clothing & Accessories. Applied various text vectorization
techniques, including one-gram multi-hot, two-gram multi-hot, two-gram tf-idf, and used LSTM with
GloVe and FastText embeddings. Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
for each encoding strategy.

VisionVista    FYP (Python)
Developed an AI-powered assistive tool using YOLOv8, Face_Recognition, and OpenAI API for object
detection, face recognition, scene description, and familiar face identification. Integrated book
scanning and text-to-speech reading to enhance accessibility for visually impaired individuals.
