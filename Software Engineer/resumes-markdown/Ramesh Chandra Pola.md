WORK EXPERIENCE

Full Stack Engineer Freelancer

June 2025 - Present
• Architected and developed a multi-tenant Business Intelligence platform from the ground up, enabling institu-
tions to securely upload, process, and visualize large-scale datasets through automated ETL pipelines, schema-
driven data modeling, and Power BI dashboards. Designed for scale and reliability using PostgreSQL (AWS
RDS), Redis (BullMQ), and Node.js, ensuring data integrity, isolation, and high performance across all
tenants.

• Led the end-to-end system architecture, development, and cloud deployment, implementing RBAC security,
CI/CD (GitHub Actions), caching, monitoring, and AWS infrastructure (S3, RDS, EC2). Owned every
technical layer, including backend, frontend, and DevOps, delivering a production-grade analytics platform that
runs with minimal latency and zero downtime.

Backend & AI Developer Jobflow

Jan 2025 - May 2025
• Built a full job portal backend in Python with scalable schemas (jobs, users, companies), integrating 15+
custom scrapers, automated apply workflows, and an NLP-based matcher using a fine-tuned 8B+ LLM. Also
delivered multiple backend projects using Node.js, Django, and FastAPI, implementing RBAC, payment
systems, real-time WebSockets, and REST APIs. Developed LLM-powered chatbots and RAG pipelines with
LangChain and vector databases (FAISS, Pinecone). Used Redis for caching, cron jobs for sync, and deployed
everything via Docker, CI/CD, and AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda).

TECHNICAL PROJECTS

Expense Management Web App

• Developed and deployed a full-stack expense tracker with React frontend and secure RESTful APIs using

Spring Boot, with data stored in MySQL (Aiven Cloud).

• Implemented CRUD operations for expense management and financial insights. Secured endpoints with JWT

authentication and Spring Security. Dockerized the backend for scalable deployment on Render.
