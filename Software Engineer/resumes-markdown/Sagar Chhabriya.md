Research Interests

My research lies at the intersection of NLP, Information  Retrieval, and Machine Learning. I study agentic RAG systems that enable autonomous question-
answering and knowledge discovery. I am particularly interested in text mining for insight extraction from unstructured data and retrieval systems that enhance
efficiency and relevance in large-scale digital environments.
